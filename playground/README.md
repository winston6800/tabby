# Tabby Playground

This directory is a sandbox environment for Tabby contributors to experiment with new features, test ideas, and work on individual projects.

## Purpose

The playground is designed to:
- Allow contributors to work on experimental features without affecting the main codebase
- Provide a space for testing new ideas and concepts
- Enable parallel development of different features
- Serve as an incubator for potential future Tabby features

## How to Use

1. Create a new directory for your project/feature:
   ```bash
   mkdir playground/your-project-name
   ```

2. Add a README.md to your project directory explaining:
   - What your project/feature does
   - How to set it up
   - How to test it
   - Any dependencies or requirements

3. Keep your project self-contained within its directory

4. When your project is ready for review:
   - Create a pull request
   - Link to your playground project
   - Explain how it could be integrated into the main Tabby codebase

## Best Practices

- Keep your playground projects modular and well-documented
- Follow the main project's coding standards
- Include tests if possible
- Document any external dependencies
- Keep the main Tabby codebase in mind when designing your feature

## Current Projects

*Add your project here when you start working on it*

## Contributing

Feel free to start your own project in the playground! Just make sure to:
1. Create a new directory for your project
2. Add appropriate documentation
3. Follow the project's coding standards
4. Keep your changes isolated to your project directory
