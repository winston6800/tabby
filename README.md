# AI Productivity Assistant

## Project Overview

**Tabby** is a Chrome extension + web app that helps users be more productive in their work — all aligned with their personal goals. It uses large language models (LLMs) to analyze freeform text and generate actionable plans, helping users stay focused on what really matters.

The goal is to create an AI-enhanced planner that feels *lightweight, transparent, and genuinely useful*, not bloated or gimmicky.

## 🎯 Core Goals


We're building Tabby because we believe there's a unmet need in how people process messy thoughts, vague intentions, and overwhelming to-do in AI

We have powerful AI tools now — but most haven't found a good way to leverage them

Tabby is an experiment: an interface where you can talk to an AI about your jumbled thoughts, your half-baked ideas, or your chaotic to-do list — and start to find clarity, structure, and aligned action.

We're not fully sure what to build yet, but we're committed to building, testing, and learning until we find something that people actually want to use — not just once, but every day.

## 🧪 Running and Adding Tests

- To add a test, create a file ending in `.test.tsx` or `.test.ts` in the `vite-react/src/` directory.
- Run all tests locally with: `npm test` (from the `vite-react` directory)
- When you push code or open a pull request, all tests will run automatically in CI (see `.github/workflows/ci.yml`).

## 🤖 Continuous Integration (CI)

- Our project uses GitHub Actions to automatically run all tests on every push and pull request.
- You can find the workflow file in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.
- This ensures that new code does not break existing functionality and that tests are always up to date.
